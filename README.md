## Introduction

This is a work of oriented object detection on IC Text.

## Research Flow
In this dataset, we have so many broken or blurry or low contrast data. So I have to analyze this dataset with a model (here I choose YOLOv8), then find a aesthetic that have most error to fix this problem.

## aesthetic_error_matrix
The ‚Äúbroken‚Äù style characters are most worth to deal with, so that Gan model will generate debroken bounding box.

## Gan model training

## Result with a simple GAN model
After training, I founded a problem that no matter which input image is the broken style will be the same.

## Result with a complex GAN model
So I change the generate model to unt_defnet152. Then the broken style of output will be different with different input image.

## Do a normal traing on YOLOv8 with more data
Before retraining YOLOv8 with Covariance Loss, I do a normal training to check if those generated image are useful.
